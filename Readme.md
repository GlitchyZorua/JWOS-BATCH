# JWOS - BATCH



This was a "OS" created by me.



It's a os that was created by me and created by Haryie (RIP, WILL MISS U <3)


Its bundled with alot of games, one of them requiring telnet.


some of them are created by Honguito98 (https://github.com/Honguito98?tab=repositories)


I'm still working on it, however, i am working on a real os.


Haryie used to help me on this, but they have unfortunately passed away.



If you want your game/app removed from this, Contact me at RetroJBOT@hotmail.com

Install JWOS by opening os_setup.bat

and boot it by opening os_boot.bat

to skip boot, open os_menu.bat

Thanks.
