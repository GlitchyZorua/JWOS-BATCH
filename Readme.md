# JWOS - BATCH



This was a "OS" created by me. Node.js is not required, Please skip the node.js part.



It's a canceled os that was created by me and created by Haryie (RIP, WILL MISS U <3)


Its bundled with alot of games, one of them requiring telnet.


some of them are created by Honguito98 (https://github.com/Honguito98?tab=repositories)



i've stopped working on this since i am working on a REAL os.


Haryie used to help me on this, but they have unfortunately passed away.



If you want your game/app removed from this, Contact me at RetroJBOT@hotmail.com


Thanks.
